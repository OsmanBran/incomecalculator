# Centrelink Income Reporting Calculator

This chrome extension allows Centrelink recipients to easily calculate the number of hours worked and the gross pay received in each period so that it can be reported to Centrelink.

## Motivation

This app was created while trying to find an easier way to report my income to Centrelink. Centrelink requires that recipients of certain payments report how much income they earn, and how many hours they have worked each fortnight. Due to being a casual worker whose pay and hours were different each fortnight, and whose payday did not align with the reporting period, the income and hours earned each period had to be manually calculated every fortnight. 

## Future additions

I plan on adding the following features in the future:
  
  â€¢ Improved error handling
