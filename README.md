# Centrelink Income Reporting Calculator

This chrome extension allows Centrelink recipients to easily calculate the number of hours worked and the gross pay received in each period so that it can be reported to Centrelink.

## Roadmap

I plan on adding the following features in the future:

  • More default pay awards to choose from (e.g hospitality general award).

  • Ability to save custom pay sets.

  • Ability to individually remove shifts from calculated period.

  • Compatability with mobile browsers.
