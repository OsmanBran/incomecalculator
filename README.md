# Centrelink Income Reporting Calculator

This chrome extension allows Centrelink recipients to easily calculate the number of hours worked and the gross pay received in each period so that it can be reported to Centrelink.

## Motivation

This app was created while trying to find an easier way to report my income to Centrelink. Centrelink requires that recipients of certain payments report how much income they earn, and how many hours they have worked each fortnight. Payday does not align with the reporting periods, meaning these numbers sometimes have to be manually calculated by adding up individual shifts. To solve this problem I decided to create this app to easily calculate my income.

## Future additions

I plan on adding the following features in the future:

  • Improve UI with Bootstrap CSS - mobile compatability + overall design
  • Improved error handling
